Californa Housing Project
The analysis focuses on estimating the median house value in California using a dataset. The primary goal is to examine the exploratory data analysis to generate bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots to visualize relationships using the variables and discover patterns in the data. The main analysis employs logistic regression which explores multiple models to predict the median house value.
